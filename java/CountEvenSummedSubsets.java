/**
 *  SOLUTION: it's actually a bit of a trick question : 
 * 
 *    since we never need to save the pairs or their sums,
 *    and the pairs we want are evens with evens, or odds with odds,
 * 
 *    it's actually only a matter of:
 *    - traverse the array once and count the number of even elements ( O(N) )
 *    - the number of odd elements is this number subtracted from N
 * 
 *    - plug in both these numbers into "combinations of N taken 2 at a time"
 *    - sum those two results
