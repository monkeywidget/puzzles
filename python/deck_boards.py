slats on a deck:
needed: 6 slats that are 9 feet long
3 slats that are 5 feet long
3 slats that are 6 feet long
available:
8 foot for $10
12 foot for $15  (was this right?)
16 foot for $18
Problem: minimize cost.  What boards should we buy?
one solution: knapsack
one solution: greedy.  Is there a local maxima where this would fail?
analysis: you can split into 3 - are there cases where this is a bad idea?
